- The class serves as a blueprint.
- Variables define state (e.g., ID, name, gender).
- Methods define behavior (e.g., updateProfile).

### 13.3.2 Object Creation Example
```java
Student john = new Student();
```
- Objects are instances of classes.
- State is initialized using variables, and methods are invoked using the dot operator.

### 13.3.3 Class and Object Illustration
- The class defines state and behavior.
- Objects (instances) have unique states.

### 13.3.4 Class Members
- Variables and methods are class members.
- Variables hold data, and methods define behavior.
- Methods may take parameters (e.g., `updateProfile(String newName)`).

## 13.4 Conclusion

Understanding classes and objects is fundamental in Java programming. Objects encapsulate state and behavior, while classes provide the structure for creating objects. In the upcoming sections of Chapter 13, we will delve into variables, methods, and constructors for a more comprehensive understanding. Stay engaged!

# Chapter 14: Understanding Classes and Objects in Java

## 14.1 Basics of Java Language

### 14.1.1 Naming Rules

#### 14.1.1.1 Classes, Methods, and Variables
- First character must be a letter, underscore, or dollar.
- Subsequent characters can be letters, underscores, dollars, or numbers.

#### 14.1.1.2 Reserved Keywords
- Around 50 reserved keywords, including "class," "int," etc.
- Cannot use reserved keywords as identifiers.

#### 14.1.1.3 No Duplicates
- Cannot have duplicate names for variables or methods in the same scope.

### 14.1.2 Case Sensitivity
- Java is case-sensitive.
- Differentiate between uppercase and lowercase identifiers.

## 14.2 Printing to the Console

### 14.2.1 Using `println` and `print`
- `println`: Prints text and advances cursor to the next line.
- `print`: Prints text and advances cursor to the end of the text.

### 14.2.2 New Line Sequence
- `\n`: Represents a new line.
- Used for formatting output.

## 14.3 Comments and Code Disabling

### 14.3.1 Single-Line Comments
- Use double slash (`//`) for single-line comments.
- Ignores the rest of the line.

### 14.3.2 Block Comments
- Use block codes (`/* */`) for multiline comments.
- Disable large sections of code.

## 14.4 Core Arithmetic Operations

### 14.4.1 Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Basic arithmetic operations in Java.
- Perform operations on variables and constants.

### 14.4.2 Modulo Operation
- `%`: Provides the remainder of division.
- Useful for finding even or odd numbers.

## 14.5 Summary

Understanding the basics of naming conventions, case sensitivity, printing to the console, commenting, and core arithmetic operations is crucial for writing effective Java code. In the following chapters, we will delve deeper into Java features and gradually build a strong foundation for advanced programming concepts.


# Chapter 15: Writing a Simple Java Program with Variables

## 15.1 Introduction
In this chapter, we will apply the concepts learned in the previous chapters to write a simple Java program that uses variables. We'll cover variable declarations, assignment statements, and demonstrate how to create a basic program structure.

## 15.2 Writing a Simple Java Program

### 15.2.1 Program Structure
- Define a class.
- Declare variables to represent student information (ID, name, age).
- Use assignment statements to initialize variable values.
- Print the student information to the console.

### 15.2.2 Code Snippet
```java
public class SimpleProgram {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Variable declarations
        int studentID;
        String studentName;
        int studentAge;

        // Variable initializations
        studentID = 1001;
        studentName = "Alice";
        studentAge = 20;

        // Print student information
        System.out.println("Student ID: " + studentID);
        System.out.println("Student Name: " + studentName);
        System.out.println("Student Age: " + studentAge);
    }
}
```

### 15.2.3 Explanation
- **Variable Declarations:** Declare variables for student ID, name, and age.
- **Variable Initializations:** Assign values to the variables.
- **Print Statements:** Use `System.out.println` to display information.

## 15.3 Compilation and Execution

### 15.3.1 Compilation Process
- Save the program in a file named `SimpleProgram.java`.
- Open a terminal and navigate to the file's directory.
- Compile the program: `javac SimpleProgram.java`

### 15.3.2 Execution
- Run the compiled program: `java SimpleProgram`
- Output:
  ```
  Student ID: 1001
  Student Name: Alice
  Student Age: 20
  ```

## 15.4 Conclusion
Writing a simple Java program involves declaring variables, initializing them, and using them to perform tasks. This chapter provided a practical example to reinforce the understanding of variables in Java.

## 15.5 Next Steps
In the upcoming chapters, we will delve deeper into Java programming, exploring more advanced concepts and building on the foundational knowledge gained so far.
